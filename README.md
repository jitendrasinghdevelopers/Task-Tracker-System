# Task-Tracker-System
A Task Tracker System built with Spring Boot that allows users to manage tasks. It supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), task status management, and searching tasks by title. The application uses an embedded H2 database for storage and exposes a RESTful API for task management.
